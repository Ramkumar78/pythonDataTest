# Python Quantitative Trading Framework

This project is a simple yet powerful quantitative trading framework written in Python. It is designed to implement and test multi-timeframe trading strategies on a list of stock tickers.

The framework currently implements a specific strategy based on a popular Pine Script indicator:
- **Buy Signal**: Daily 5 EMA crosses above 13 EMA, and the Daily 14-period RSI is greater than 50.
- **Sell Signal**: 4-Hour 5 EMA crosses below 13 EMA.

## Features

- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Fetches and analyzes data on both Daily and 4-Hour timeframes.
- **Configurable Tickers**: Easily manage the list of stocks to analyze via a simple `scripts.csv` file.
- **Detailed Signal Logging**: When a trading signal is generated, it is printed to the console and saved to a date-stamped CSV file for historical analysis.
- **Extensible Strategy**: The core logic is encapsulated in a `TradingStrategy` class, making it easy to modify or extend.

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd trading_framework
```

Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

To specify which stocks you want to analyze, simply edit the `scripts.csv` file. Add or remove ticker symbols as needed, with one ticker per line. Make sure the column header is `TICKER`.

**Example `scripts.csv`:**
```csv
TICKER
AAPL
GOOG
TSLA
```

## Usage

To run the trading analysis, execute the `main.py` script from within the `trading_framework` directory:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The script will then perform the following steps:
1. Load the tickers from `scripts.csv`.
2. For each ticker, download the required Daily and 1-Hour historical data.
3. Resample the 1-Hour data to a 4-Hour timeframe.
4. Apply the trading strategy to find buy or sell signals on the most recent data point.
5. Print any new signals to the console.
6. Log the details of any new signals to a CSV file.

## Output

### Console Output
When a signal is found, a detailed alert will be printed to your console:
```
*** ALERT: New BUY signal for AAPL ***
    Date: 2025-08-17, Price: 150.25, RSI: 55.30, ATR: 3.45
```

### Signal Log File
All generated signals are saved in a CSV file named `signals_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` in the project's root directory. This file contains the following columns:
- `Ticker`: The stock symbol (e.g., `AAPL`).
- `Date`: The date of the signal.
- `Signal`: The type of signal (`BUY` or `SELL`).
- `Price`: The closing price at the time of the signal.
- `RSI`: The Daily RSI value.
- `ATR`: The Daily ATR value.

This log allows you to keep a historical record of all trading signals generated by the framework.
